      "prompt": "A surreal, high-detail digital tableau unfolds within a dim, blood-red-lit corridor where shifting ink-like shapes ripple along textured surfaces, revealing a floating empress castle adorned with twisted spires and luminous pearl white walls that glow softly against the eerie twilight, its grandeur contrasted by the tumultuous, dark psychedelia-inspired atmosphere infused with scarlet accents and shadowed depths, as if the scene is a transient dreamscape suspended between reality and nightmare, evoking a sense of haunting majesty and mysterious allure that invites endless exploration through intricate textures, warped reflections, and surreal lighting effects that dance across the scene, creating an immersive visual symphony of otherworldly architecture and hypnotic ink-shape motion, all bathed in a ghostly, atmospheric glow that shifts subtly from pearl brightness to scarlet intensity, conveying a tension between serenity and chaos in this fantastical, labyrinthine realm.",
